## Introduction

This code provides a C++ implementation of a Fibonacci heap, a specialized priority queue data structure known for its efficient operations. The Fibonacci heap is a versatile data structure that supports insertions, extracting the minimum value, and decreasing key values efficiently.

## Data Structures

### Node

The `Node` struct represents a node in the Fibonacci heap. Each node contains the following fields:
- `key`: The value associated with the node.
- `child`: A pointer to the first child of the node.
- `left`: A pointer to the previous node in the circular, doubly-linked list.
- `right`: A pointer to the next node in the circular, doubly-linked list.
- `parent`: A pointer to the parent node.
- `degree`: The number of children of the node.
- `mark`: A boolean flag (1 if marked, 0 otherwise).

### Fibonacci Heap

The `fibonacci_heap` struct represents the Fibonacci heap itself. It includes the following fields:
- `head`: A pointer to the head of the circular, doubly-linked list of root nodes.
- `min`: A pointer to the root node with the minimum key.
- `n_nodes`: The total number of nodes in the heap.
- `n_tree`: The number of root trees in the heap.
- `cmp`: A comparator object for comparing keys.

## Functions

### insert

```cpp
void insert(const T x)
```

- Inserts a new node with the given value `x` into the Fibonacci heap.

### heap_union

```cpp
void heap_union(fibonacci_heap<T, CMP> heap)
```

- Unites the current Fibonacci heap with another heap.

### print_roots

```cpp
void print_roots()
```

- Prints the circular, doubly-linked list of root nodes.

### print_children

```cpp
void print_children(const Node<T>* a)
```

- Prints the children of a given node `a`.

### extract_min

```cpp
T extract_min()
```

- Removes and returns the node with the minimum key from the Fibonacci heap.

### decrease_key

```cpp
void decrease_key(Node<T>* x, T new_key)
```

- Decreases the key of a given node `x` to a new value `new_key`.

## Private Functions

This code includes several private functions such as `linking`, `scambio`, `consolidate`, `cut`, and `cascading_cut`, which are used to implement various operations of the Fibonacci heap data structure.

## Usage

You can use this C++ code to work with Fibonacci heaps for various priority queue operations, such as inserting elements, extracting the minimum value, and decreasing key values. Simply include the `fibonacciheap.hpp` header file and use the provided data structures and functions in your application.

```cpp
#include "fibonacciheap.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create a Fibonacci heap
    fibonacci_heap<int, std::less<int>> fibHeap;

    // Perform operations on the heap
    fibHeap.insert(42);
    int minVal = fibHeap.extract_min();
    // ...

    return 0;
}
```
